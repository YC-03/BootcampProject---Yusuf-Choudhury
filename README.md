# BootcampProject---Yusuf-Choudhury

Name - Yusuf Choudhury
Group 5

My project I done through the 2 week coding bootcamp at City, University Of London

I created a sandpile animation where a user can press the 'r', 'b' and 'g' to increase the colour whereas the capital letters of the same letters decrease the colour allowing you to customise the sandpile to your fitting while it's animating. You can also press 's' to stop the animation
